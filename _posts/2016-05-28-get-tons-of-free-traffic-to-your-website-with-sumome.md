What if I told you that you could get hundreds - or even thousands - of new visitors to your website every day for free? Sounds great, doesn't it? Well, that's exactly what SumoMe is promising us with its latest tool called <a href="http://bit.ly/1NVoqXR">Discover</a>.

Discover is simple: It’s a widget you install on your site that contextually recommends articles from other websites to your readers. If a reader clicks on a link to another site, you earn credits that can be used to essentially buy traffic back from other sites that have installed the widget to a selected number of pages or posts.

This widget could be especially useful for smaller sites wishing to gain more traffic or even bigger sites, because no matter how much traffic you have, you always want more.

And the best part? Anyone can access Discover for *free*, including the 190,000 sites that already use SumoMe’s suite of traffic-growth optimization tools (me included!). The only thing you have to do is <a href="http://bit.ly/1NVoqXR" target="_blank">sign up for a free SumoMe account</a>, install the widget, and you're all set!

However, there’s a catch. To unlock all of Discover’s features, like the abililty to promote multiple links at the same time, you'll need to upgrade to the Pro version, which comes with a 14-day free trial.

Still, if you're trying to drive more visitors to your website, you should definitely give Discover a try. Do let me know in the comments about your experience if you have!
