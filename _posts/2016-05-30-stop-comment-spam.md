Ah, comment spam. Anyone who runs a blog will be familiar with it, from the insincere compliments to, frankly, gibberish churned out by copy spinning programs. 
Simply put, comment spam is something every blog suffers from (you might have chanced upon them while browsing your favorite blogs) and they can be a huge problem if not taken care of, resulting in a lot of lost traffic, revenue, and potential readers.

In this article, I'll be going through a few ways you can help cut down on that annoying comment spam on your blog, as well as how to distinguish spam from comments that actually add value to the conversation and are more worth your time.

<h2>Identifying comment spam</h2>
Comment spam can take many different forms, but they usually look something like this:

Comments like these don’t add anything useful to the conversation, so why do people even publish them at all?

Well, they’re a sleazy way for the commenter to get free links and traffic to their site. Instead of earning a link by creating valuable content and asking you to link to it, the spammer just leaves a useless comment that doesn't add any value to the conversation containing a link to whatever they want to promote. 

<h2>Not taking care of comment spam will harm your blog</h2>
So you might be thinking: comment spam may be annoying, but will it actually do anything harmful?

Well, not preventing comment spam can be harmful to your blog's growth in many ways, including:
<ul>
<li><b>Comment spam breaks the trust bonds between you and your readers.</b> When you allow all those links to malware and pornography sites in your comment area and one of your readers click on them (resulting in something terrible happening), that reader will lose faith in you and may never return to your site.</li>
<li><b>Comment spam affects your SEO.</b> Including a single spam link on your site can cause search engines to start ranking you lower on their results pages.</li>
<li><b>Comment spam makes you look like a lazy beginner. </b>All those spammy links in your comment area gives your readers an impression that you're just an inexperienced beginner who doesn't know how to take care of a blog's comments.</li>
</ul>

Now that you've learnt about the different risks comment spam pose to your blog, it's time to start banishing them from your blog.
<h2>Preventing comment spam</h2>
In this section I'll be going through a few ways on how you can start getting rid of comment spam from your blog. Depending on your own needs and your blogging platform you may find that different approaches suit you better. 
<h3>Option #1: Configure WordPress to minimise spam</h3>
As one of the most popular blogging platforms in the world, <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> is particularly attractive to spammers wishing to take advantage of the CMS to automate spam comments.

However, with the right tools and configuration, you can actually set up WordPress to eliminate comment spam from your blog. Here are some settings you can change:
<h5>Hold comments in moderation until you approve them.</h5>
Start by configuring WordPress to send all comments to moderation, which means every comment will be sent to you (or a group of moderators) for approval before getting published on your site.

Navigate to Settings > Discussion in your WordPress dashboard.
Check the boxes next to “Anyone posts a comment” and “A comment is held for moderation” under “Email me whenever….”.
Then check “Comment must be manually approved” in the section called “Before a comment appears.”
The only downside of manually moderating your comments is that your readers won’t immediately start seeing their comments appear on the site after they submit them, which is potentially discouraging for them, and could slow down the conversation.

You’ll also need to spend time handling the emails as you watch over the discussion on your blog.

<h5>Turn off trackbacks.</h5>
A trackback is a notification that another site has linked to one of your posts.

For instance, if another blogger links to your post in his own blog and decides to send you a trackback, you’ll get a notification in your inbox about it. If you approve the trackback, you’ll then see that trackback in the comment area of your original post. 

Unfortunately, trackbacks are often abused and can be a frequent cause of comment spam.

To turn them off, go to Settings > Discussion > Default Article Settings, and uncheck “Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks).”

The only downside to turning them off is that you won’t get automatically notified when someone else links back to your site, but trackback notifications are actually fairly uncommon these days, so you probably won’t miss out much in terms of conversation on your blog.

<h5>Automatically close comments after a specified amount of days on all your posts.</h5>
You will get most of your valid comments during the first few weeks after you publish a post. If you close comments after that, you’re not likely to lose engagement from real readers.

Comment spammers scour the Web looking for older, popular blog posts to hit, which means that all of the posts in your archive are potential targets.

To close comments on every post after a specified number of days, go to Settings > Discussion > Other Comment Settings and check the box next to “Automatically close comments on articles older than” and choose 30 or 60 days in the selection box.

<h5>Use spam-blocking plugins</h5>
There are quite a few spam-blocking plugins out there, but the only one I use and recommend is <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Askimet</a>. It automatically marks comments as spam, thus saving you or your moderators the hassle of manually combing through every comment.

<h2>Option #2: Use a third-party platform</h2>
Third-party comment-hosting services externally host comments posted by users to blog posts. But don't worry - your comments will still appear on your blog posts, even though they’re hosted somewhere else.

A great example of how this works is my own blog. I use <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for my blog comments, so feel free to scroll down to the bottom of one of my blog posts and take a look.

Such blog comment-hosting services take the comments completely off your blog, and moves those comments to its own servers. In doing so, it runs the comments through strict filters that will remove the vast majority of spam comments.

Third-party comment-hosting services also:
<ul>
<li>Provide analytics to recognize your top commenters, see what content inspires the most reactions, and more.</li>
<li>Encourage visitors to read more of your content by recommending new posts to them.</li>
<li>Gives you powerful comment moderation features like ban lists, spam controls, word filters, commenters reputation, and more. </li>
</ul>

Installing a third-party comment-hosting service is easy. Simply follow their setup instructions - most of the time you'll be asked to install a plugin or even embed a snippet of code to your blog's theme, provided that you're experienced enough to do it yourself.

Some popular services include <a href="http://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> and <a href="http://web.livefyre.com" target="_blank">Livefyre</a>.

<h2>Option #3: Turn off comments entirely</h2>
If there are simply too many spam comments on your site, you may have no other choice but to turn off comments entirely. If you turn off comments entirely, there will be no way spammers can leave spam comments on your blog, taking out the stress and frustration when it comes to moderating comments.

For obvious reasons this is certainly not an action to be taken lightly, but under certain circumstances - for instance, if you’re blogging in a niche where even the bigger sites don’t inspire many comments - it could be worth considering.

But if you don't allow comments on your site, you will miss out on ample opportunities to build strong relationships with your readers by listening to their opinions and answering any questions or doubts they might have. Of course, a reader could always contact you directly, but starting a conversation in the comment area will always be more engaging than sending an email - it allows anyone to join the discussion, for instance.

<h2>A spam-free environment is worth fighting for</h2>
So, you may have read about the different ways of preventing comment spam, but you're probably thinking: "Is it really worth all my effort to get rid of comment spam? I mean, it seems like a very troublesome thing to do..."

The thing is, a spam-free environment *is* worth fighting for. Your readers will thank you for it, Google won't penalise your site, and at least it's something you can be proud of for achieving, right? :) You get to publish content in a spam-free world. How amazing is that?
