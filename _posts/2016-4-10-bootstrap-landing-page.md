After some hard work, I've finally made my Bootstrap landing page template available for download! The template features a clean and minimal design, with an 'About' section, a 'Pricing' section and a 'Contact' section to provide your visitors with additional information about your product or services. It is also fully compatible with Bootstrap 3.0.

Take a look at the demo [here](http://brunotandev.github.io/bootstrap-landing-page) or click [here](https://github.com/brunotandev/bootstrap-landing-page/archive/master.zip) to download it right away.
