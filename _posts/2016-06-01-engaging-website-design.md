Not only does it raise the aesthetic appeal of your website, it also ensures that you keep them happy, engaged and coming back. If you keep them happy enough, they might even start recommending your website to their friends and family, driving tons of potential leads to your website!

In this post, I'll be going through the 5 things you can do to engage your website visitors.

## Step 1: Less is more

Take a look at your website's design right now and cut down on all that extra clutter that doesnâ€™t add to the user experience or worse, confuses or distracts the user. If you're using WordPress, strip your sidebars of all those useless widgets you don't need - it'll simplify the user experience, as well as speed up your website.

Remember, users want things to be as simple, worry-free and fast as possible. If they can see what's coming next before even clicking on something, they'll be happy users.

## Step 2: Design for the user

It may be tempting to design the website based on your own styles and preferences, but remember - the most important thing is to keep your users in mind.

Think about what they want to do on your website and help them complete those tasks in the most intuitive way possible. Are they watching video? Downloading software? Searching for specific information? 

Remember, it's your job to look at the user experience and make sure that users can navigate your user interface as easily as possible without getting confused or frustrated.

## Step 3: Size input fields accordingly

Instead of the usual buttons, text boxes or radio buttons, try using jumbo-sized buttons and giant text fields - you'll see user engagement increase and bounce rates drop.

This is because when you make things bulky and oversized, it's automatically easier to use, therefore taking out a lot of possible frustration on the user's part.

## Step 4: Don't forget about mobile users

Your mobile users are as important as your desktop users. Today, 4 out of 5 consumers use their phones to do online shopping - that's a pretty huge user base! 

To cover mobile users, you could always use a responsive theme for your website, or create a mobile-optimised version of your website and redirect your mobile visitors there. Whichever tickles your fancy.

Before launch, always test your website on your smartphone or tablets, or use a tool like [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/) to see if everything looks alright.

## Step 5: Never stop improving

The chances of you hitting the bull's eye on your first try is pretty slim, so remember to keep gathering more information about the performance of your site and tweak the user experience accordingly.
