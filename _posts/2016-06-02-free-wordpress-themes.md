Recently, I came across this [excellent post](https://smartblogger.com/free-wordpress-themes/) from the friendly folks over at [SmartBlogger](http://smartblogger.com) on how using a free WordPress theme could actually do more harm than good. Go check it out if you have the time - I'm sure you'll enjoy it!

After reading the article, I decided to come up with 3 more warning signs your free WordPress theme is sabotaging your website. Hope you enjoy!

## 1) You're getting less traffic from search engines

As pointed out by [SmartBlogger](http://smartblogger.com), most free WordPress themes are poorly coded. And guess what that leads to? Less organic traffic from search engines.

Yes, that's right - the structure and code of your website can have a huge impact on your website's SEO. If a theme is poorly coded and structured, it lowers your search ranking on Google, resulting in you getting less organic search traffic. Not very pleasant, eh?

## 2) Your website is littered with spammy advertising links

Hidden, spammy advertising links placed by the developer can be hard to remove. Some might be as straightforward as a footer text link to the developer's website, but others might be as obscure as inserting ad links into your posts. 

Either way, these spammy links can seriously hurt your website's user experience, and you might even start getting complaints from users about them.

## 3) Your visitors are getting hit by malware

This is the worst case, where the theme developer intentionally (but sometimes unknowingly) inserts malware or other malicious code directly into the theme's source code, especially if you download your theme from untrustworthy sources.

You can avoid this by only getting free themes from reputable sources, such as from the [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org) website itself, but still the safest solution is to get a premium theme.

I hope you enjoyed today's post! If you've got time to spare, please do read the [original SmartBlogger post](http://smartblogger.com) that inspired me to write this.
