Creating your website is just the tip of the iceberg - you’ll have to work on getting your website indexed by Google so that people will be able to find your website through search.

<!--excerpt-->

I bet you have this question: how do you ensure that your website is indexed as quickly as possible? In today’s post I’ll be going through the basics of how websites are crawled and indexed by Google, as well some great ways to get your website or blog crawled and indexed as quickly as possible and with minimal effort.

## Uhhh, so what's crawling and indexing?

Crawling is the process where the Googlebot (the search bot software that Google uses) goes around from website to website searching for fresh content which the Googlebot finds through sitemaps and links. After that, it reports all this information back to Google. Got that? Great!

Indexing is the processing of the information gathered by the Googlebot from crawling websites. During indexing, the Googlebot processes the keywords on a page and where they are located. Once documents are processed and determined to be of quality content, they are added to Google’s searchable index. 
 
## Get your website crawled and indexed by Google
 
Now that you understand how crawling and indexing works, here are some of the best ways you can get your website discovered by Googlebot.
 
### Create a sitemap
 
A sitemap is an XML document that lists down each page on your website, and tells search engines when new pages have been added and how often to check back for changes on specific pages. 
 
For example, if you own an online store, you might want Googlebot to check your homepage daily for new products and deals on your website.

Using WordPress? Good news - you can install the [Google XML Sitemaps plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/) on your website and have it automatically create and update your sitemap for you as well as submit it to search engines. For those who aren't using WordPress, you can use a tool such as the [XML Sitemaps Generator](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).

Once you've created your sitemap, [submit your sitemap to Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/100283?hl=en). 

### Create social profiles for your website

Crawlers find your website through links (remember what I said just now?), so one easy way to get some links is to create social network profiles for your new website and add a link to your website there.

Yes, this does include Twitter profiles, Facebook and Google+ pages, LinkedIn profiles or company pages, Pinterest profiles, and YouTube channels.

### Create offsite content

To help in the link building process, get some more high-quality links to your new website by creating offsite content, such as submitting guest posts to other similar blogs in your niche, articles to quality article directories, and press releases to services that offer search engine optimisation and distribution. 

Oh yes, and please note this is all about quality content from reputable sites – you don’t want Google to think that your website is spammy by submitting content to spammy websites.

## Conclusion

The above may seem quite troublesome, but trust me - once your website or blog has been indexed by Google, you'll start to see your organic search traffic skyrocket. This process will happen even faster if you have set up a sitemap for your website.
